# Salary Prediction Classification

"Salary Prediction Classification üí∞"
Our project in the ISE291 course.

The goal of this project üéØ was to embrace the role of a data scientist. In this project, we imported a dataset from Kaggle and went through all the necessary procedures to build the model and predict whether an individual will make less than or greater than $50,000.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Discovery: This process helps us set the objective, the hypothesis, and explore the types of features we have.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation: This is one of the most important phases. We clean data, handle inconsistencies, handle missing data, and detect outlier data.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Planning: In this phase, we analysed the data and made graphs to get a better understanding of the features. We determined the relationship between the variables. Finally, we summarised the findings.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building: We use three classification models. Decision tree classification, Random forest Classification, and Naive Bayes Classification. After that, we summarised the findings and found that Random Forest Classification was the suitable model for prediction as it showed the highest accuracy among other models.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Result Communication and Operationalization: Here, we evaluate our model and compare its accuracy. In addition, we set guidelines for adoption and identified potential implementation issues.
